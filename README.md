# jsMSX

Unofficial mirror of jsmsx repo.

Original repo is on [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsmsx/).

Original author is [Marcus Granado](mrc.gran @ gmail.com).

## README from the original author

jsMSX is a MSX emulator 100% written in JavaScript. Yes, you read it: JavaScript! It emulates the underlying Z80 CPU, TMS9918 Video Display Processor (VDP), PPI, RAM slots and Megaram. In its present form, it should be able to run any program or game developed for MSX 1.0.

If you think you'd like to participate, are just curious or want to say hello, please have a look at the project.

Portions of the initial JavaScript code was derived from Arnon Cardoso's Java MSX Emulator (first Java MSX emulator), Murilo Queiroz's Java Phoenix Emulator (first Java Arcade emulator) and Davidson&Pollard's Z80 class of the
 Spectrum Java Emulator, after reading this thread: http://www.msx.org/forumtopic4176.html. Thank you all for your past efforts!
